# Gold-Price-Prediction
Machine Learning Model

In this project, I utilized exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization techniques to predict the price of gold, treating it as a regression problem.

Firstly, I conducted EDA on the dataset to understand its structure, identify any missing values or outliers, and gain insights into the relationships between variables. This involved statistical summaries, histograms, scatter plots, and correlation analyses to grasp the data's characteristics.

Next, I preprocessed the data, which included handling missing values, scaling features, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance effectively.

For the regression task, I selected an appropriate regression algorithm, such as linear regression, decision tree regression, or random forest regression, based on the dataset's characteristics and complexity.

After training the regression model on the training data, I evaluated its performance using metrics such as R-squared error to assess how well the model fits the data. An R-squared error of 0.9899 indicates that the model explains approximately 98.99% of the variance in the gold price, suggesting a strong fit.

To visualize the model's predictions, I plotted a graph comparing the actual gold prices with the predicted prices. The close alignment between the actual and predicted values, with a 99% match, demonstrates the effectiveness of the regression model in capturing the underlying patterns in the data.

Overall, this project successfully demonstrated the power of exploratory data analysis and regression modeling techniques in predicting the price of gold, providing valuable insights for investors and stakeholders in the gold market.
